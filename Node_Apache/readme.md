Simple Node.js Development VM

This project aims to make spinning up a simple local Node.js test/development environment incredibly quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the wonderful world of Node.js development on local virtual machines.

It will install the following on a CentOS 7 Linux VM:

    Node.js (latest version in EPEL repository)
    Express
    A simple demonstration Node.js app

It should take 5-10 minutes to build or rebuild the VM from scratch on a decent broadband connection.
